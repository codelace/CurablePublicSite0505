    title: '1. Introduction', 
    body: `The life‑sciences industry stands at an inflection point.

• R&D costs for a single FDA‑approved therapeutic now exceed US $2.5 billion and 12–15 years of development time.*

• 90 % of drug candidates fail before Phase III.*

• Promising IP often stalls inside "valleys of death" created by siloed funding, regulatory red‑tape, and monopolistic data practices.*

Curable Labs proposes a radically open, blockchain‑native alternative that pairs decentralized governance with AI‑guided discovery. By uniting researchers, patients, investors, and technologists in a borderless digital laboratory, we aim to compress timelines, lower costs, and distribute both risk and reward more equitably than any legacy pharma model can.` 
  },
  { 
    title: '2. Mission Statement', 
    body: `To democratize the discovery and development of life‑saving cures by giving every qualified contributor—scientist, patient, or supporter—both a voice and an economic stake in the breakthroughs they help create.

Our north star is a world where treatments move at the speed of collective intelligence, not bureaucratic inertia, and where the benefits of those treatments accrue to humanity at large instead of a privileged few.` 
  },
  { 
    title: '3. Global Community at the Core', 
    body: `Borderless by design.
Curable Labs dissolves geographic and institutional barriers through:

Mechanism	Impact
On‑chain Treasury	Anyone can audit how funds are raised, allocated, and spent.
Open‑Access Data Lake	Experimental results, negative or positive, are published with permissive IP‑NFT terms.
Quadratic & Role‑weighted Voting	Expertise is weighted without disenfranchising newcomers.
Bounty & Fellowship Programs	Scientists from under‑resourced regions can earn tokens by completing critical tasks.

These pillars foster a meritocratic environment where collaboration eclipses competition.` 
  },
  { 
    title: '4. Bridging DeFi & Biotech', 
    body: `Traditional biotech finance relies on venture capital, non‑dilutive grants, or Big Pharma licensing—slow, opaque paths ill‑suited to urgent global health needs. Curable Labs fuses DeFi liquidity tooling with scientific diligence:

Tokenized IP‑NFTs
Intellectual‑property non‑fungible tokens anchor provisional patents or know‑how to an immutable chain record. Fractional ownership lets thousands back a single lead compound at micrometer precision.

Streaming Grants
Funds are streamed via smart contracts contingent on predefined milestones (e.g., docking benchmark, cell‑line efficacy). Unmet milestones automatically pause disbursements, protecting contributors.

Transparent Royalty Routing
Revenues from out‑licensing or asset sales flow back to token holders with auditable smart‑contract logic.` 
  },
  { 
    title: '5. Democratizing Biotech', 
    body: `Curable Labs eradicates three systemic gatekeepers:

Gatekeeper	Legacy Barrier	DAO Alternative
Capital Access	Elite VC networks, grant committees	Permissionless token sales & quadratic donations
Data Ownership	Paywalled journals, proprietary databases	Open‑licensed data lake bound to IP‑NFT provenance
Research Direction	C‑suite driven pipeline priorities	Community voting & patient‑advocacy signal

The result: research agendas that reflect global disease burdens, not just market potential.` 
  },
  { 
    title: '6. Unlocking Global Talent', 
    body: `"Talent is everywhere, opportunity is not." — Patrick Collison

Curable Labs's Talent Mesh flips that axiom:

Proof‑of‑Contribution—Every experiment, literature review, or code commit is hashed, timestamped, and credited.

Reputation Staking—Contributors can stake $CURE to back the validity of their work; malicious or low‑quality submissions risk slashing.

Dynamic Incentives—High‑impact tasks (e.g., validating an ALS target) earn bonus rewards, voted in real time by token holders.` 
  },
  { 
    title: '7. AI‑Powered Drug Discovery', 
    body: `Curable Labs integrates a modular "Agentic" pipeline:

Stage	Agent Role (automated)	Human Validation Point
Ideation	Large‑language models mine literature & clinical databases for targets	Scientific Advisory triage
In‑silico Screening	Docking & ML binding‑affinity agents screen 10⁸ molecules/week	Medicinal chemists review top 0.1 %
Simulation & ADMET	Agentic loop refines hits with toxicity, solubility, and RMSD filters	Wet‑lab partners confirm
Regulatory Pathfinder	NLP agents index FDA / EMA guidelines, generating tailored checklists	Regulatory leads sign‑off

This synergy compresses lead‑optimization cycles from quarters to weeks.` 
  },
  { 
    title: '8. Staffing Solutions & DAO Structure', 
    body: `Curable Labs operates four concentric circles of responsibility:

Circle	Token Requirement	Powers
Observer	None	View data, comment in forums
Contributor	≥25 $CURE	Submit work, earn bounties
Guardian	≥2.5 k $CURE	Vote on funding & governance proposals
Advisor	By election	Vet science, sit on peer‑review panels

A lightweight Multisig Executor enforces time‑locks and emergency vetoes to preserve protocol integrity.` 
  },
  { 
    title: '9. Governance, Team & Tokenomics', 
    body: `9.1 Token Design – $CURE
Category	Allocation	Vesting
Core Team (Founders + Leads)	30 %	1‑yr cliff → 3‑yr linear
Capital (Public + Future Sales)	19 %	Liquid at TGE for liquidity provisioning
Treasury Reserve	51 %	DAO‑controlled, streaming to grants pool
Total	100 %	

Trigger Point: 12 months post‑TGE
Initial Unlock: 25 % of Core‑Team tranche
Linear Vesting: remaining 75 % monthly over 36 months

9.2 Governance Mechanics
Proposal Creation — any Guardian with ≥500 $CURE may propose.

Deliberation Window — 5 days forum debate + snapshot integration.

Vote — quadratic weight capped at 5 % per address to curb plutocracy.

Execution — on‑chain, timelocked 48 h for emergency review.

9.3 Key Personnel
Hugh Donatello — Chief Executive Officer, biotech commercialization veteran.

Ilyssa Evans — Chief Operations Officer, AI & Web3 strategist.

Scientific Advisory — led by Dr. Ralph Snodgrass (immunology, FDA liaison).

Core Engineering — distributed team specializing in agentic AI and smart contracts.`

  { 
    title: 'Conclusion', 
    body: `Curable Labs delivers a playbook for 21st‑century drug discovery—open, intelligent, and relentlessly mission‑driven. By blending:

Agentic AI that iterates in silico thousands of times faster than any wet lab,

On‑chain governance that democratizes direction and dollars, and

Tokenized IP that realigns incentives toward patient impact,

we intend to turn today's R&D bottlenecks into tomorrow's breakthroughs.

Join us. Stake your expertise, curiosity, or capital and help cure the incurable—together.
